- the amdcpus_motheboards_memoryram database is responsible for leaving all ram memories from both AMD and INTEL (both may or may not use the same).

### Get /motheboard/AMD

- This endpoint is responsible for returning the list of all motheboards-AMD registered in the database.

#### Parameters

- Nothing

#### Response

##### Ok! > Status 200

- If this is the response returned, it means that everything went well and you will receive the motheboard-amd listing from the bank.
  Example answer:

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "motheboard": "B550 AORUS PRO ELITE 2",
        "motheboardversion": "B550"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "motheboard": "B550 AORUS PRO ELITE 2",
        "motheboardversion": "0"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "motheboard": "B550 AORUS PRO ELITE 2",
        "motheboardversion": "B450"
    }
]
```

<hr>

### Get /motheboard/:id

- This endpoint is responsible for returning the listing of a specific motheboard-AMD through the id.

#### Parameters

- Id dof motheboard in router:
  example:
- http://localhost:4567/motheboard/2

#### Response

##### Ok! > Status 200

- If this is the response returned, it means that everything went well and you will receive the motheboard-AMD listing for that ID.
  Exemplo de resposta:

```
{
    "id": 10,
    "motheboard": "A320 DSh2 Gigabyte",
    "motheboardversion": "A320"
}
```

##### Authentication failed! > status 400

- If this is the response returned, it means that the motheboard was not found.
  Example answer:

```
Not Found
```
